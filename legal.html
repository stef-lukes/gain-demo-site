                  A common misconception is that it is all about the number of
                  followers, but it’s not at all. Most agencies will use
                  follower bots that generate thousands of followers per month –
                  but these are almost all fake accounts. We focus on targeting
                  people that will really be interested in your business.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The amount of targeted followers you can expect depends on
                  your industry, the package you choose, and the quality of your
                  content – but to give you an example: a recent women’s
                  clothing brand that subscribed to our services (including
                  Facebook Advertising and our Follower Growth Service) saw 574
                  new Facebook page likes, 354 new Instagram followers, and 298
                  new Twitter followers in their first month.

                  Once you have signed up with Gain and have an account, we'll
                  begin manually growing your Instagram account. Growth results
                  will vary, typically long term sustainable growth is achieved
                  with 2-3 month. It may take a few weeks for your account manager
                  to optimise your accounts growth. You can expect to see anywhere
                  from 100 to 400 genuine followers per month, the longer you use
                  this service the greater the gain will be.
